2.  Has the claimant sustained a ‘minor injury’ as defined in the SABS? 
 
According to the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule (SABS), a minor injury is defined 
as  one  or  more  of  a  sprain,  strain,  whiplash  associated  disorder,  contusion, 
abrasion,laceration, or subluxation and includes any clinically associated sequelae to 
such an injury.  
From strictly a musculoskeletal perspective, the claimant has sustained a minor injury as 
defined in the SABS.  
 
Ms.  Doe  reported  a  pre-existing  history  of  ovarian  cancer,  which  was 
diagnosed in 2009. The claimant underwent two surgeries as a result of this condition <PAGE_SEPARATOR>Page 4 of 6

and is currently in complete remission.    
Ms Doe previously underwent the following surgeries: two procedures to treat her 
ovarian cancer in 2009; removal of kidney stones “more than ten years ago”; and cesarean 
sections in 1981, 1984, and 1990.  
 
Ms Doe was involved in a previous motor vehicle accident in 2016. The claimant 
did not sustain any injuries from her previous accident.  
 
However, it is my opinion that no concurrent or pre-accident conditions exist that have 
contributed to the current clinical presentation nor are there any concurrent or pre-accident 
conditions that will hinder recovery. Accordingly, the Minor Injury Guideline applies to this 
case.
