## summarize the claimants medical history and the nature of the injury.
Jane Doe was involved in a rear-impact motor vehicle accident on December 6, 2017. She reported immediate headaches and pain in her cervical spine with radiation down her right arm, and loss of consciousness for an unknown duration. At the time of the assessment, she had undergone two months of physical rehabilitative treatment and reported being 5% improved. She had a pre-existing history of ovarian cancer, which was diagnosed in 2009 and is now in complete remission. She also had surgeries to remove kidney stones and cesarean sections in 1981, 1984, and 1990. The assessment concluded that she had sustained cervicogenic headaches, cervical myofascial strain, thoracic myofascial strain, and nonspecific low back strain. The customary healing times for soft tissue injuries is 12-16 weeks and the claimant was encouraged to continue with her return to physical activity and incorporate some core strengthening and a cardiovascular program.

## what is the severity of the injury and is it consistent with accident in question?
The claimant has sustained predominantly soft tissue injuries and extensive passive therapy has already been utilized. From strictly a musculoskeletal perspective, the claimant has sustained a minor injury as defined in the SABS.

## are there any pre-existing conditions that may have contributed to the injury? If so, please explain. (else say: '...')
Ms Doe reported a pre-existing history of ovarian cancer, which was diagnosed in 2009. The claimant underwent two surgeries as a result of this condition and is currently in complete remission. Additionally, Ms Doe previously underwent the following surgeries: two procedures to treat her ovarian cancer in 2009; removal of kidney stones “more than ten years ago”; and cesarean sections in 1981, 1984, and 1990. However, it is my opinion that no concurrent or pre-accident conditions exist

## does the claimant suffer an impairment of function as a result of the injury sustained in the accident?
Yes, the claimant has sustained a minor injury as defined in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule (SABS). From strictly a musculoskeletal perspective, the claimant has sustained a minor injury as defined in the SABS.

## are the limitations described in the medical report consistent with the claimants description of the injury?
Yes, the limitations described in the medical report are consistent with the claimant's description of the injury.

## has adequate information been provided to assess the claimants impairment?
Yes, adequate information has been provided to assess the claimant's impairment.

## if applicable, when should the claimant be reassessed? (e.g. 6 months, 12 months, 24 months)
The customary healing times for soft tissue injuries is 12-16 weeks and the collagen re-modelling phase can take up to twelve months. Functional recovery typically occurs at 20 weeks. At times, pain can continue past the 1-year mark.

## is the claimant eligible for the benefit?
No, the claimant is not eligible for the benefit as the Treatment and Assessment Plan (OCF-18) is not considered reasonable and necessary.
